- Aim to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default

## Conclusions
- Small Business Loans: Since most defaulters are observed to be taking loans for small business purposes, it may be advisable for lenders to implement stricter screening criteria for applicants seeking loans for small businesses. This could include a more thorough assessment of the business plan and financial stability of the business.​
- Higher Annual Income: The data shows that defaulters tend to have lower annual incomes. Lenders could consider setting minimum income thresholds for loan applicants to reduce the risk of default. Additionally, offering financial literacy resources to help borrowers manage their finances could be beneficial.
- Grade G and F Loans: Lenders should be cautious when approving loans with Grade G and F, as these grades are associated with higher default rates. It may be wise to limit the issuance of such loans or charge higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk.​
- Higher Interest Rates: Defaulters are more likely to have loans with interest rates greater than 16%. Lenders should be cautious about extending loans with very high-interest rates, as this may make it difficult for borrowers to meet their repayment obligations. Proper assessment of the borrower's ability to repay at such rates is crucial.​
- Economic Crisis Impact: The observation that most defaulters are from the year 2011, which was a recession year, highlights the impact of economic crises on loan defaults. Lenders should consider macroeconomic factors and market conditions when assessing loan applications during economic downturns.
- Loan Term: Defaulters are more common among loans with a 36-month term. Lenders might consider offering shorter-term loans or closely monitoring loans with longer terms to mitigate the risk of default.​
- Experience Level: Borrowers with no years of experience are more likely to default. Lenders should assess the stability and income potential of borrowers with limited work experience more rigorously.
- Bankruptcy Records: Borrowers with public bankruptcy records are at a higher risk of default. Lenders should exercise caution when dealing with applicants who have a history of bankruptcy and may implement stricter eligibility criteria or charge higher interest rates to mitigate the risk.
